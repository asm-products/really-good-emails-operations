Tumblr --- Content Guide
=====

[![Tumblr Dashboard][producti]][product]

We use Tumblr to power our blog. This is a short breakdown of how.

Goal
-------

The primary goal of our Tumblr is to share interesting content around email design, deliverability, and engagement. Every post ought to address one of these two goals:

- improve readers’ product emails sharing how other teams are putting together their emails; and
- provide readers with the resources they need to improve their own product emails.

Content Types
-------

Tumblr has seven content types. They are not to be used in equal measure.

- **Text** --- Text posts ought to be reserved for longer form, original content. Interviews, essays, etc.
- **Photo** --- Photo posts are a great way to link to other sites where the primary draw is an image. In particular, it’s an ideal format for highlighting an email from the main site on the blog.
- **Quote** --- For sharing key quotes, obviously. Quotes ought only be a sentence or two, and should always be accompanied with attribution and a source link. Do not give captions / commentary for quotes: they ought to stand alone.
- **Link** --- This is the workhorse of post formats. Best used when your aim is to share a article and provide some commentary. If the commentary becomes substantive, consider reformatting the post as a full-throated, original blog post with a mention of the article that got you thinking.
- **Chat** --- Use when you *would* use the **Quote** format, but the text you are quoting is a dialog between two people.
- **Audio** --- As a general matter, we ought not use the audio post type.
- **Video** --- The video post type ought to be used when the primary item to be shared is a video (obviously). Think of it like the photo post type, but for video content. It ought always include some commentary explaining why visitors would want to watch it and what you thought was interesting / compelling about it.

Authors
-------

All members of the [Core Team][core] will have access to publish to the Tumblr blog.

Post Frequency
-------

There’s no firm quota, but we’d like to keep the blog from feeling stale. A handful of posts per week ought to be a decent start.

Also, *feel free to make liberal use of Tumblr’s queue feature.* If you’ve found a bunch of articles at a time, write them all up and queue them. They’ll be posted in a staggered way.
